        <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <div class="article-text">
            <p>The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran is based on Islamic teachings and the historical experience of the Iranian nation. This Constitution guarantees national sovereignty, independence, freedom, and social justice based on Islamic principles.</p>
            
            <p>The Islamic Revolution of Iran, led by Imam Khomeini (may he rest in peace) and with the broad participation of the people, overthrew the monarchical system and established the Islamic Republic.</p>
            
            <p>The fundamental difference between the Islamic Republic of Iran and other political systems lies in the fact that it is based on Islamic ideology and the sovereignty of God, while ensuring popular participation in governance.</p>

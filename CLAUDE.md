# Iran-e Bidar - Constitutional Democracy Platform

## Mission Statement
Iran-e Bidar is a collaborative platform for constitutional discourse and civic participation, enabling transparent, community-driven development of constitutional amendments through democratic processes.

## Platform Philosophy
- **Transparency**: All processes are open and auditable
- **Participation**: Low barrier to entry, GitHub account sufficient to start
- **Democracy**: 75% approval threshold for amendments
- **Bilingual**: Equal support for English and Persian languages
- **Quality**: Multi-stage review and refinement process

## Democratic Process Flow

### 5-Stage Amendment Process
1. **Discuss** → Open dialogue and idea development
2. **Propose** → Formal amendment drafting  
3. **Review** → Multi-stakeholder evaluation
4. **Approve (75%)** → Community voting and consensus
5. **Release** → Publication and implementation

### Process Example Path:
  1. Discussion: Philosophy debate (2 months)
  2. Issue #156: Specific proposal created
  3. Project: Amendment tracking started
  4. Wiki: Research documented
  5. Pull Request: Text changes proposed
  6. Community stuck at 67% approval (need 75%)
  7. Back to Discussion: Refining proposal
  8. Modified Issue #156: Updated proposal
  9. New Pull Request: Revised text
  10. Release v2.5: Success!

 Project-Issue Relationships

  1. One Project → Multiple Issues

  Most common for constitutional work
  Project: "Article 19 Digital Rights Amendment"
  ├── Issue #156: Add digital assembly rights
  ├── Issue #157: Define "digital platform" legally
  ├── Issue #158: Address enforcement mechanisms
  └── Issue #159: International law compatibility

  2. One Issue → Multiple Projects

  Complex issues affecting multiple areas
  Issue #200: "Women's rights need constitutional protection"
  ├── Project: "Gender Equality Amendment"
  ├── Project: "Economic Rights Update"
  └── Project: "Education Access Reform"

  3. Project Without Issues

  High-level planning
  Project: "Constitutional Review 2025"
  ├── Direct tasks (not issues)
  ├── Milestones
  └── General coordination

  4. Issues Without Projects

  Simple, standalone problems
  Issue #300: "Typo in Article 15 Farsi translation"
  Status: Simple fix, no project needed

  For Constitutional Work, I'd Recommend:

  Thematic Projects

  Project: "Digital Rights Package"
  ├── Issue: Article 19 (Assembly)
  ├── Issue: Article 22 (Privacy)
  ├── Issue: Article 24 (Communication)
  └── Issue: Article 26 (Information access)

  Process Projects

  Project: "Community Engagement Workflow"
  ├── Issue: Improve voting system
  ├── Issue: Better expert review process
  └── Issue: Translation coordination

  Think of Projects as organizing containers that can hold Issues, but don't have to.

  Would you like me to show you how to structure projects for your constitutional platform?

## Testing Infrastructure

### Automated Testing Scripts
Located in `/scripts/` directory:

#### Link Testing
- **`test-links.js`**: Validates all internal navigation links
- **`test-approval-links.js`**: Specifically tests process flow clickability
- **`verify-approval-links.js`**: Verifies approval process integration
- **`test-all-stages.js`**: Comprehensive stage page testing

#### Visual Testing  
- **`test-screenshots.js`**: Captures homepage and main page screenshots
- **`test-approval-pages.js`**: Screenshots approval process pages
- **`screenshot-stage-page.js`**: Individual stage page screenshots

#### Usage Example
```bash
# Test all navigation links
node scripts/test-links.js

# Visual regression testing
node scripts/test-screenshots.js

# Comprehensive stage testing
node scripts/test-all-stages.js
```

### Screenshot Testing Process
1. **Puppeteer Automation**: Headless Chrome browser automation
2. **Multi-language Testing**: Both English and Persian pages
3. **Responsive Testing**: Desktop viewport (1200x800)
4. **Full Page Capture**: Complete page screenshots for review
5. **Manual Review**: Visual inspection for layout issues

### Quality Assurance Checklist
- All internal links functional
- Process flow fully interactive  
- RTL/Persian rendering correct
- Responsive design working
- Visual hierarchy clear
- Accessibility standards met

## Discussions Integration Plan

**GitHub Action Workflow**:
- Trigger: Discussion events + hourly schedule + manual
- Fetch discussions via GitHub API
- Use Google Translate API for bilingual support
- Generate `_data/discussions.yml` with both `en` and `fa` versions
- Auto-commit triggers GitHub Pages rebuild

**Site Structure**:
- `/en/discussions/` shows English versions (translated if needed)
- `/fa/discussions/` shows Persian versions (translated if needed)
- Original language indicated with badge

**Translation**: Google Translate API key stored in GitHub secrets, translations cached to avoid re-processing unchanged content.

## User Experience Design

### Information Architecture
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity on demand
- **Two Primary Actions**: Join Discussions, Propose Changes
- **Educational Gateway**: Process flow links to detailed explanations
- **Bilingual Equity**: Equal treatment of English and Persian content

### Navigation Patterns
1. **Homepage**: Overview and primary actions
2. **Process Flow**: Interactive 5-step visual guide
3. **Stage Pages**: Detailed explanations of each process step
4. **Content Pages**: Lists of discussions, issues, projects, etc.
5. **GitHub Integration**: Seamless transition to contribution

### Accessibility Features
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmarks
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA labels and descriptions where needed
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance
- **RTL Support**: Proper Persian text rendering and layout
